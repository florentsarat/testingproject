= Generate SVG from plantuml diagram
:nofooter:

Graphviz must be installed for plantuml to work properly. See https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/[^] to install graphviz on your system.

All `.plantuml` files found at the root of this folder will generate an `.svg` in the `images` folder. + 
A BDM class diagram and a group organization chart are generated by default. + 
You may also create your own uml diagram (sequence, use case, deployment...) using https://plantuml.com[plantuml^]. A set of non-UML diagram is also supported (Ditaa, Gantt diagram...).

To insert your own diagram in the generated documentation you will have to customize the generation templates and include your diagram svg image using `image::imageName.svg[]` at the desired location in the template.
